# Autonomous Multi-Agent MCP Test Harness

This repository contains the blueprints and implementation for an autonomous, multi-agent test harness designed to rigorously validate and stress Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations. The harness is built on a modular architecture, allowing you to select and combine different types of agents to create comprehensive and repeatable test scenarios.

## Project Vision

The goal of this project is to create a robust and extensible tool for ensuring the stability, performance, and security of any MCP server. By using specialized, independent agents, the harness can go beyond simple functional tests to identify complex, hard-to-find issues like race conditions, memory leaks, and protocol vulnerabilities.

## Agent Catalog

The harness is composed of various agent types, grouped into families based on their function. This modular design allows for incremental development, where you can start with a core set of agents and add more advanced ones as your needs evolve.

### ðŸŸ¢ Core Protocol Agents (Baseline)

These agents form the foundation of the test harness, ensuring basic protocol compliance and functional correctness.

* **Compatibility / Compliance Agent:** Validates the fundamental MCP protocol handshake. It checks for schema compliance, correct message ordering, and proper version negotiation.

* **Functional Agent:** Executes and validates scripted test workflows. It ensures that multi-agent handoffs, tool invocations, and state propagation work as expected.

### âš¡ Performance & Scale Agents

This family of agents is designed to test the MCP server's limits under various load conditions.

* **Load Agent:** Simulates a high volume of concurrent clients. It's used to measure key performance indicators like throughput and latency under typical operating conditions.

* **Stress Agent:** Pushes the server beyond its designed capacity with extreme concurrency or oversized data payloads. It's used to determine failure thresholds and observe graceful degradation.

* **Soak Agent:** Runs tests over an extended period to detect long-term issues such as memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

### ðŸ”’ Robustness & Security Agents

These agents are dedicated to finding vulnerabilities and ensuring the server is resilient to malicious or malformed input.

* **Fuzzing Agent:** Injects unexpected or invalid data, such as malformed messages and random payloads, to test the server's resilience to bad input.

* **Negative Agent:** Intentionally violates the MCP protocol to confirm that the server correctly rejects invalid flows and handles errors gracefully.

* **Security Agent:** Attempts to exploit security flaws by testing for things like unauthorized tool invocations, privilege escalation, and token replay attacks.

* **Injection Agent:** Specifically tests for command, prompt, or unintended tool execution vulnerabilities.

### ðŸ”€ Reliability & Chaos Agents

This family of agents focuses on testing the server's ability to handle and recover from failures.

* **Chaos Agent:** Introduces controlled failures like network disruptions or process termination to test the system's resilience and recovery logic.

* **Fault Injection Agent:** Simulates specific error conditions, such as bad responses or timeouts, to verify the server's retry and error handling policies.

* **Resilience Agent:** Measures system recovery metrics, like Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) and retry success rates.

### ðŸ§© Workflow & Scenario Agents

These agents enable more complex, real-world testing by orchestrating multi-agent interactions and testing interoperability.

* **Scenario Orchestration Agent:** Combines multiple agents into complex end-to-end workflows to mimic real-world usage patterns.

* **Interoperability Agent:** Tests communication and consistent semantics between different MCP server implementations.

* **Flakiness Detection Agent:** Runs the same scenario multiple times to measure variance and identify unstable or "flaky" tests.

### ðŸ“Š Observability & Reporting Agents

These agents provide the essential feedback loop, collecting and visualizing test results and system metrics.

* **Reporter Agent:** Gathers structured test results from all agents and generates comprehensive reports in various formats (JSON, HTML, JUnit).

* **Metrics Agent:** Aggregates and exposes standardized performance metrics like latency and throughput.

* **Tracer Agent:** Captures distributed traces to visualize the sequence of interactions in multi-agent workflows.

### ðŸ§ª Advanced / Future Agents

This category includes more sophisticated agents for future development.

* **Coverage Agent:** Tracks which MCP features and endpoints are exercised during a test run to ensure comprehensive protocol compliance.

* **Adaptive Test Agent:** Uses AI/LLM capabilities to dynamically propose and generate new test cases based on observed behavior.

* **Interference Agent:** Introduces competing workflows or cross-talk to test the isolation between different test runs.

* **Benchmarking Agent:** Compares the performance of different MCP server implementations, producing leaderboard-style results.

## Implementation Roadmap

The project will be implemented in phases to ensure a stable foundation before adding complexity.

* **Phase 1 (Minimum Viable Product):**

  * **Core:** Implement the **Compatibility Agent** and **Functional Agent** to ensure a baseline for all tests.

  * **Reporting:** Implement the **Reporter Agent** to provide a clear view of test results from the start.

* **Phase 2:**

  * **Load & Security:** Add the **Load Agent**, **Fuzzing Agent**, **Security Agent**, and **Chaos Agent** to begin testing performance and robustness.

* **Phase 3:**

  * **Refinement & Advanced Scenarios:** Introduce the **Interoperability Agent**, **Flakiness Detection Agent**, **Coverage Agent**, and the initial **Adaptive Test Agent** to tackle more complex and subtle issues.
